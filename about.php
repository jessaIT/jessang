                            the community and seeing the difficulties of the residents in their basic needs, the
                            group agreed to put up 100 pesos each for a sari-sari store which will be placed at
                            Wilma Galanido’s Residence wherein she will also be the caretaker. The group composed of

                            total membership 37 and was named Bliss Community Multi-Purpose Cooperative (BCMPC). In
